            <h2>Scan your Artwork</h2>
            <p>
            At Firebird 3D, the goal of 3D scanning is to capture your art work digitally so that you can explore using technology to expand your collection. From monument scans to miniatures, anything is possible with 3D scanning.

            <h2>Life Scanning</h2>
            <p>
              With our scanning technology, we can even capture living people! The amazing Artec software can compensate for slight movement in order to capture the likeness of a person. This can be used for life size armatures, or even 3D printing people as you see them.

            With our high resolution resin, you can create small miniatures with high detail. You can 3D scan a monument,   and with this resin create a miniature, holding the same detail as the original.

            <h2>CNC foam cutting</h2>
            <p>
            Using a foam armature carved from a CNC machine can be very helpful for an artist. Instead of creating your own armature by hand, this machine will create a proportional replica of a scanned Maquette, life scan, or any 3D file. The capabilities are endless with enlarging

            <h2>How it Works</h2>
            <p>
              A 3D file obtained from a scan, or digital model, will be cut up for optimal cutting, and sent to the machine. The CNC goes from a file created from the layed out pieces of art, and follows a cut path that was programmed. Each piece will be assembled and chased for your convenience.
